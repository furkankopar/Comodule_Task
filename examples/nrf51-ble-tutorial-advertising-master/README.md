# nrf52-ble-tutorial-advertising
This example is meant to be used together with the tutorial "A beginner's tutorial: Advertising" that is found at https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/b/bluetooth-low-energy/posts/ble-advertising-a-beginners-tutorial. The purpose of the tutorial is to get you started with the basics of the nRF52 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The tutorial is fairly superficial and is meant to be a hands-on introduction to BLE advertising and broadcasting of a limited payload. Hopefully after going through these steps you will be able to set up a BLE link, advertise your intentions and send your first bytes of data over the air. 


Requirements

<ul><ul>
<li>nRF52 DK
<li>nRF52 Dongle or an additional DK
<li>SEGGER Embedded studio
<li>nRF Connect
<li>SDK V15.x.x. 
<li>For nRF52 DK use SoftDevice S132 Vx.x.x
</ul></ul>

Other kits, dongles and software versions might work as well, but this is what I have used. This tutorial will not cover how to install and setup the software. Please search the forum if you run into trouble before posting questions here. 

To compile the example download the files and copy the folder "nrf52-ble-tutorial-advertising" to "your_SDK_folder\examples\ble_peripheral". Your main.c file should then be found in the folder "your_SDK_folder\examples\ble_peripheral\nrf52-ble-tutorial-advertising". 

Further instructions and links to firmware and software are provided in the tutorial.

Please post any questions about this project on https://devzone.nordicsemi.com.
